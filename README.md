# Playground and Notes for different programming languages
In this repo I'll document notes, tricks, overthinking, code snippets or other things I go through while learning and working, I hope anyone would benifit from it and add their notes as well.

## C++
* [Pointer to members of classes](https://github.com/FaresSalem/Playground-and-Notes/blob/master/C%2B%2B%20Notes/Pointer%20to%20member.cpp)
* [Does a const reference class member prolong the life of a temporary?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/2784262/11024053)
* ### Code snippets
    * [String iteration benchmark](https://github.com/FaresSalem/Playground-and-Notes/blob/master/C%2B%2B%20Notes/string%20iteration%20performance%20.cpp)
* ### What's the difference between ... ?
    * [Functions in namespaces and static methods class members](https://stackoverflow.com/q/1434937/11024053)
    * [Function overloading in C++ passing arguments by value or by reference](https://stackoverflow.com/q/38957516/11024053)
