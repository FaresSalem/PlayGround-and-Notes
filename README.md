# PlayGround and Notes for different programming languages
This repo is to document notes, tricks, overthinking, code snippets or other things I go through while learning and working, I hope anyone would benifit from it and add here their notes as well, It's a code playground as well were you can just clone the repo and try running any code on your machine.
